    + Breaks+Replaces old package
  * Reorder control fields a bit
  * Move qmldir file from libkf5solid5 to declarative package
    + No move relationship introduced because of the experimental nature of
      the packages.
  * Rename qtdeclarative5-kf5solid-5.0 to qtdeclarative5-kf5solid
    as versions mean next to nothing in qml and unless a future incompatible
    version introduces a version in the file path they won't be co-installable
    anyway.
